<font face="DejaVu Serif">In the misty hills of K'achola, stone steps path the slopes. The way Never begins nor ends as they are built from the feet of the rock of and mark their heights
 from peak to peak. Nobody built them, nobody maintains them, nobody uses them, time has forgotten their purpose. They belong to nature, it will decide when they will fade. Our eyes look and
 perceive that an older version of ourselves must have put them there,  they seem to contain such design and intent, we mourn for their disrepair, and fantasize how great we once where in order
 to construct them. They are best seen as the sun rises and the mist is just rising off their shape, it appears that  they are slowly dissolving into the clouds. Yet they remain and the sun shines
 on the grey rock mapping the contour of the mounds. The rocky climb up to them is tough and is not a trail much traveled anymore by sightseers, but it really is a sight of wonder that famously caught
 the imagination of those adventurers who came here from the West. One man wrote:</font>

"The Stairs of K'achola are 10,000 years old and are the earliest signs of architecture in the entire K'achola region, most definitely the most well preserved of all the Semanian civilisation structures.
 Most likely built by one of the Early Semanian Sun Kings as a great quarry to gain access to the rich gold reserves that was once inside these valleys, constructed through a dedicated slave workforce,
 the location was also had highly religious connections as it would be the closet point to the sun where the Kings would hold blood sacrifices to please the spirit world. Semanian culture, although superstitious,
 was highly advanced for its time, channels under the ground might have been used for a <a href="EachFileIsAnEntryPoint.html"> network</a> of roads between settlements or irrigation channels and excavated skeletons in the royal tombs even show early 
evidence of dentistry."

It came to be that actually those precious reserves had been relatively untouched  by these ancient peoples, It was not until later colonisers came to seek the fabled fortunes that lay inside this holy site,
 the gold, platinum and silver all came to be removed from the hills to the halls and manors of the great and rich. The last valuable resource to be excavated was Hellitite, a precious metal named after the man
 who first came to this region from the west, Charles William Helliver. He would be the first to tell the world about this place and claimed rights over these lands. His decedents would utilize this extremely
 rare and useful metal for computer chips, it was sent back in shiploads to the factories where its would make the most intricate computers ever produced. A Hellitite chip can transfer a trillion gigavett of 
data every second, this powered every major system computer, and hyper-machine in the capitals; it was an unexpendable resource for sure. The materials found beneath K'achola is the catalyst for the new computer
 age, it has opened up a world quite unlike the world that has been lost here. In a way sacrificing one set of ideas for another, It makes me wonder what world will be opened up when the machines of our world
 become obsolete themselves, what will time do to the landscapes of man, how long will it be until nature takes back what we have taken from her and begin to <a href="Opening.html">reset the clock.</a> </p></font>
