 <P>Despite there dedicated development of city layout the greeks lay little importance on cultivating private garden spaces. As they did in places like Eygpt and India.</P>
 <P>The people of Crete put more worth on nature and its contents and the from the layout of ruins of their palaces it is likely they developed ajoining gardens onto their open palaces.</P>
 <P>Homer's poems give us an understanding of the aproach to gardening when time allowed. Laetres, father of Odysseus, is said to of gone to the fields at hearing of the loss of his son and when his son returned finds arranged rows of fruit-trees and vine espaliers ringed by a fence of thorn-bushes. </P>
 <P>Alcinous, ruler of the Phaiacians, had a beautiful fruit garden near the grove of Athene, that Odyesseus visits ( VII 112 ff) 
 "<P>"Now, you'll find a splendid grove along the road뾭oplars, sacred to Pallas뾞 bubbling spring's inside and meadows run around it.There lies my father's estate,his blossoming orchard too,as far from town as a man's strong shout can carry.</P>
 <P><a href="Rotating.html">Take a seat there</a> </P> 
 "<P>Here luxuriant trees are always in their primepomegranates and pears, and apples glowing red,succulent figs and olives swelling sleek and dark.And the yield of all these trees will never flag or die,neither in winter nor in summer, a harvest all year round."</P></P>
 <P>Homer notes another of Alcinous gardens more like the farm garden of Laetres and possibly similar to the gardens of Mycenae and while Homer speaks of its charm it seems to be simple and functional </P>.
 <P>It is not that the greeks didnt apreaciate the concept of nature; as many myths of the nymphs in their magical groves that remain in blossom all seasons like the nymphs of Hesperides who live in a grove at the edge of the world.</P>
 <P>Temples and shrines would tend to use groves and sacred trees as part of their rituals and sacred trees are distinct by being non-fruit bearing forest trees. The sacred tree would be planted between the spring and the altar, few examples being a palm when Odysseus meets Nausicaa and the great oak at Dodona when he hears the voice of the Thunderer.  These shrines in groves spread troughout Roman empire and the cult of Isis that reached as far North as the Danube. along the limes.</P>
 <P>The cult of Adonis (and plant pots) The cult of Adonis was a offshoot of the cult of Aphrodite around 600 B.C. Adonis was the lover of Aphrodite who was killed by a boar sent by Artemis and Ares jealous o Adonis. The festival of Adonis was performed by women in midsummer where they would plant crops in pottery ontop of their roof, perhaps the origins of plant pots.</P>
 <P>Philosophers gardens where the first of a elite group to move away from the public Gymnasiums and baths to set up their own private spaces away from the noise and crowds of the demos. Notably Plato began to teach his pupils in his private garden closeby to the gynasium which he lent to the use of schooling as it was used until the time of Justinian. This became known as the academy and inside its grounds was bulit a Exedra and mueseum. Plato then lived there within the grounds.</P>
 <P>Epicurus also had a garden within the city walls which Pliny ascribes to being the first town garden which many Romans would in turn copy to create for themselves pleasure parks within the walls of their cities.
 <P>"hitherto it has not been the custom to bring the country into the town"</P></P>
