Blankness at first. Suddenly a whirr from underneath you ; Icons of a dead art rise from the <a href="Ether.html">ether</a>, 
they slowly churn, distorted.  Off beat, out of tune, flat, uncanny. This ruined <a href="Vista.htm">vista</a>  becomes a hub for all those bums who seek out these dives, not a bird song to be 
heard just as *They* like it.  The illusive and  intriguing *They* made it this way.  If something becomes as rotten as these walls it becomes desirable 
to them. *They* placed those beams of light to glare in the faces of strangers. *They* bind their belongings together with strings of text to unsecure them from ownership
 *They* embedded the sense of dread with the noises of machines *They* alienated themselves by the allure of science fantasy
Realness and craft are reminders that in the end they are scrollers and clickers. Typing away until new text appears.
