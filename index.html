  <p LANG="en"> -By a still lake side a pearl  white shell rests upon the water, its grooves fall inwards creating a  vessel that suspends the figure of Venus in the air from the ground  bellow. The scene is gently lit by sunlight, to the right stands an  alcove of tall narrow trees that branch upwards with sharp leaves  that cut into the sky. Beyond, the coastline is broken up by outcrops  of land with hills rising from the water. In the distance, touching  upon the horizon a flat plateau lies far out and is the furthest  point of sight. Trees line its shore and a mound marks the meeting  between earth and sky.</p>
  <p LANG="en"> All eyes lay on the Venus and  hers lie outwards past us. Her body is pale and smooth like marble,  her neck is swan like, tilted to one side and her expression is  melancholic. She holds herself against the elements as the sun casts  a delicate shadow over her soft form, mapping the contours of her  figure. Her feet rest angled on-top of the shell, one twisted behind  letting the weight of her pose shift rightwards. The hair of Venus  flows in a great mass in the wind, reaching down to her thigh  creating a great wave of golden locks. </p>
