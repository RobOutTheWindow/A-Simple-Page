  <p><i>I wrote this in the past imaging a future, but I dont think thats what I meant by talking about stations or anything just that sometimes
 a time when your thinking about all three at once is intresting point to work from, as we often only think in one station at a tme. I ve had to go and edit this too so its not all untouched writing</i>.</p> 

My flat was covered in paintings with my window looking out to the sea. It is suprising I never painted the sea in those days;
 I guess I never painted things so familiar to me. The waves had become my white noise, always on standby. My paintings where of space mainly; Stars, planets, comets, black holes and supernovas. 
 I wanted to show Space in an old light, Science has demystified the subject to such an extent that it feels less myeterious and more a big lot of complicated nothing its a problem in the way its 
taught to us I'm sure, we definitley arent encouraged to become astronaughts, its just antoher topic in the text book next to Nuclear power statioins  and spray painting cars with static electircty. 
It has moved away from  the ancient idea of the planets and the stars as gigantic <a href="Tesserect.html">divine bodies that govern us from the heavens</a>  to another industry to be learnt from but never questioned. Science magazines
 publish images of them next to microbes and plant matter; making them feel small and relatable and so losing their mystery somewhat. We know what makes up stars now; which is sad to me. No one in the western
 world will ever have the same connection to night sky as the ancients had because they would have been taught that the light comes from the fusion of hydrogen and helium, and not just a by product of the 
highest level of being. Scientists had been able to figure out how to replicate this process on earth so that they can now power our computers with the energy it creates. This fusion is highly dangerous 
so they tested it out in a machine  in the middle of an American desert, then made versions all around the world thats how we know its safe. 

<i><p>I wrote some dialouge here but it was bad .</p></i>

I continued my space series for what seemed like years, but could only been a month or so, I was waiting for my ship to come in, by which I mean my next idea for which to build.
 That was my main purpose, building space not painting Space. I never made things that didn't exist before; I would take exact forms from archectecture I saw and copied it into 
a new place, often in a brownfield site on the edges of cities. I had moved to Dublin last year to start work on a new project but these things cant just happen, planning permission
 is hard to get when your building has no forseeable purpose.
<p>Standing in one of these places  felt like I wasn't standing there at all, non-places I think they are called. Think airports or little chefs, you know what it feels like to be in one, 
but every one youve been in merge into a homogenous memory-space.All things are done in time it may seem to have three stations, past, present, and future, yet the first and the last of 
these are not (one is not now, and the other is not at all) But we do have a past and not only should we work with what weve done, but its really the only thing we can do: recycle it.</p>
